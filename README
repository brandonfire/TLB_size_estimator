Program to measure the size and cost of accessing a TLB

The idea of tlb.c is simple, we use two arguments to define how many pages you want to access in one test and how many trails you want to repeat.

The output will tell us the avarage access time of one single page table entry.


Simply type "make" to get binary files.

to make a series test, type ./run
series test will test the form 1 pagenum to 2power11 and report aveage accessing time.

to make a single test, type ./tlb Pagenum Trails

Arguments:

arg1:
Pagenum: This is an integer indicating the total page numbers you want to measure in this test.
Trails: This is an integer indicating how many loops you want to repeat for the page numbers reading.
